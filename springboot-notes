A single @SpringBootApplication annotation can be used to enable those three features, that is:

@EnableAutoConfiguration: enable Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism
@ComponentScan: enable @Component scan on the package where the application is located (see the best practices)
@Configuration: allow to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes
The @SpringBootApplication annotation is equivalent to using @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan

if you can use any of these separately if you don't want to use @SpringBootApplication
